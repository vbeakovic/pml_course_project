# Practical Machine Learning - Course Project

## Introduction

This repository is a course project for the Practical Machine Learning Course on
Coursera. 

## Data used for this assignment
This assignment uses data provided at the course website (<a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a>). 
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement â€“ a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it.

More  information about the data may be found in the the <a href="CodeBook.md">CodeBook.md</a> in the root of this repository.

## Goal of the assignment
The goal is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to classify manner in which the exercise was done. The exercise (Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl) was done in five different fashions: 

* Class A exactly according to the specification
* Class B throwing the elbows to the front 
* Class C lifting the dumbbell only halfway 
* Class D lowering the dumbbell only halfway  
* Class E throwing the hips to the front


## Files and directories in the repository
* files directory - contains csv files with the source data for the assignment
* CodeBook.md - info about the data, files, transformations and variables
* pml_course_project.Rmd - R markdown file that allows to reproduce the research
* pml_course_project.md - markdown file produced by renderging the Rmd file
* pml_course_project.html - html file produced by rendering the Rmd file
